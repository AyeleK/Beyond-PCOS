              <p>
                <strong>1. When were you diagnosed?</strong><br>
                I was originally diagnosed at 18. I noticed something was off when i would go 3+ months without a period.
              </p>
              <p>
                <strong>2. What did your doctor explain?</strong><br>
                Originally, it was explained that the hormone imbalance was connected with my weight/obesity. I carry a large amount of fat around my mid-section which was said to negatively impact my health/hormones/menstrual cycle. 
              </p>
              <p>
                <strong>3. Symptoms?</strong><br>
                I had an almost daily bleeding for over a year, which was a nuisance. However, as I’ve managed to lose weight, my menstrual cycle has started to become more regular. Unfortunately , I still deal with facial hair growth, which means plucking or shaving several times a week. 
              </p>
              <p>
                <strong>4. How do you manage it?</strong><br>
                I currently utilize compounded Semaglutide to manage my blood sugar and assist with weight loss. 
              </p>
              <p>
                <strong>5. Advice for others?</strong><br>
                Utilize online resources! There’s much more information and research on PCOS now, then 5-10 years ago! Many have been able to reverse their PCOS symptoms. There’s no cure or exact medication, but <br><strong style="color: #6a1b9a;"><q>treating your body well and learning what works with your body is the best practice!</q></strong>

              <h2>Nusrat Noha's story</h2>
              <p>
                <strong>1. When were you diagnosed?</strong><br>
                I was officially diagnosed with PCOS when I was 19, but I had symptoms throughout my teenage years. My period was never regular, and I noticed that my friends would have one or two cycles before I even had one. That’s when I first realized something wasn’t right, even though I didn’t fully understand what it meant back then.
              </p>
              <p>
                <strong>2. What did your doctor explain?</strong><br>
                When I was around 14, I brought up my irregular cycles to my regular doctor, but it was dismissed as “normal for my age.” Later, a gynecologist ran an ultrasound and blood work and explained that my hormones were imbalanced, which can cause irregular periods. When I was 19, another gynecologist officially diagnosed me with PCOS and explained that things like my irregular periods, facial hair, and uneven skin tone were all connected to the condition. She also told me that carbs and sugar can make symptoms flare up because of insulin spikes that are common with PCOS. She emphasized how staying active and maintaining a healthy weight can really help keep symptoms more balanced.
              </p>
              <p>
                <strong>3. Symptoms?</strong><br>
                I’ve experienced irregular periods, changes in hair growth, and uneven skin tone. These symptoms didn’t stop my daily life, but they definitely made me insecure at times and pushed me to look for real answers about what was going on with my body.
              </p>
              <p>
                <strong>4. How do you manage it?</strong><br>
                I’ve been trying to manage my symptoms by staying active and making small changes to my routine. I try to work out regularly, whether it’s at the gym or at home. I’ve also added a few supplements that are commonly recommended for PCOS, like inositol, vitamin D, NAC, and magnesium glycinate. Along with being more mindful about sugar and carbs, these steps have helped me feel a lot more balanced overall.
              </p>
              <p>
                <strong>5. Advice for others?</strong><br>
                PCOS can feel scary and isolating at first, but it’s so much more common than people realize, and you are not alone. Managing symptoms isn’t always easy, and staying consistent can be a challenge, but every small step you take really does make a difference. What matters is that you keep trying and get back to your routine whenever you can.<br><strong style="color: #6a1b9a;"><q> Be patient with yourself, trust your body, and don’t be afraid to advocate for your health. You’re stronger than you think, and with time you can learn what works best for you.</q></strong>

              <p>
                <strong>1. When were you diagnosed?</strong><br>
                I was diagnosed in Jan 2024 when I was having very irregular period and growing facial hair very young age.
              </p>
              <p>
                <strong>2. What did your doctor explain?</strong><br>
                The doctor briefly explained what PCOS was but didn’t provide much additional information, and they mentioned that there is no cure for it. 
              </p>
              <p>
                <strong>3. Symptoms?</strong><br>
                My daily symptoms include hair loss, facial and chest hair growth, very long periods, feeling constantly tired, and hormone levels that always seem out of balance. 
              </p>
              <p>
                <strong>4. How do you manage it?</strong><br>
                I used a tea from The Goddess Collection to help stop a period that had continued for a year and eight months, and it genuinely worked for me. I also used Myo-Inositol and D-Chiro to support my weight, and they were effective. Along with that, I’ve been working on managing my stress, which has helped improve my overall symptoms. 
              </p>
              <p>
                <strong>5. Advice for others?</strong><br>
                Cholesterol levels also play a role, and I tried to keep mine low. I think that may be one of the reasons my period lasted so long. Over time, I realized that you have to find what works best for your own body. .<br><strong style="color: #6a1b9a;"><q>Every PCOS journey is unique, what works for someone else might not work for you, so it’s important to understand and listen to your body!</q></strong>
